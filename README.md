# 📚 Libft – 42 School C Library

**Libft** is the first project in the **42 School curriculum**, where you build your own **C library from scratch**.  
The goal is to **reimplement a set of standard C library functions** and additional utility functions that will be used in future projects throughout the curriculum. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

At 42, students are not allowed to use some standard libraries in later projects, so creating your own version of these functions helps you better understand **C fundamentals**, **memory management**, and core programming concepts.

## 🧠 Project Overview

- Recreate common functions from the C standard library (`libft`)  
  – character checks, string manipulation, memory operations, etc. 
- Implement additional useful functions (`ft_substr`, `ft_strjoin`, `ft_split`, etc.) :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- Bonus part: build your own linked list functions for dynamic data structures 
- The library is compiled into a static `.a` file (e.g., `libft.a`) using a `Makefile`  
- This library becomes a **foundation** for future 42 projects
